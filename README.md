# OpinionMiner-NLP-Based-Sentiment-Classification

A comprehensive machine learning and deep learning project that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using various NLP techniques. This project demonstrates the full sentiment analysis pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to training models and evaluating performance.

## Overview

This project explores text classification through:

* **Traditional ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
* **Neural Networks**: Feedforward Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* **Vectorization Techniques**: TF-IDF and GloVe Embeddings
* **Model Optimization**: GridSearchCV and pipeline integration for hyperparameter tuning

## Dataset

* **50,000 movie reviews** labeled as either *positive* or *negative*
* Preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization

## Key Features

* End-to-end text preprocessing pipeline
* Implementation of both ML and DL models
* Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Log Loss, ROC, PR curves, Confusion Matrix, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient
* Deep learning models built with Keras using embedding layers and pre-trained GloVe vectors

## Evaluation Metrics

* GridSearchCV for best hyperparameters
* ROC & Precision-Recall Curves
* Learning and Validation Curves
* Classification Reports with detailed metrics
